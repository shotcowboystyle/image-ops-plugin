# Open Image Workspace

```bash
CONFIG="${CLAUDE_USER_DATA:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/claude-plugins}/image-ops/workspace.json"
test -f "$CONFIG" || { echo "No image workspace registered. Run workspace-setup first."; exit 1; }

# jq is the happy path. The fallback must be portable: `grep -oP` is GNU-only and
# errors out on the BSD grep that ships with macOS, which is exactly the case the
# fallback exists to cover.
WS=$(jq -r .path "$CONFIG" 2>/dev/null) \
  || WS=$(sed -n 's/.*"path"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' "$CONFIG")
test -d "$WS" || { echo "Workspace path missing: $WS"; exit 1; }

case "$(uname -s)" in
  Darwin)
    open -a Terminal "$WS" || open "$WS"
    ;;
  *)
    if command -v konsole >/dev/null; then
      konsole --workdir "$WS" &
    elif command -v gnome-terminal >/dev/null; then
      gnome-terminal --working-directory="$WS" &
    elif command -v xdg-open >/dev/null; then
      xdg-open "$WS" &
    else
      echo "No terminal opener found — printing the path only." >&2
    fi
    ;;
esac

echo "Workspace: $WS"
ls -la "$WS"
```

`konsole` / `gnome-terminal` / `xdg-open` are Linux-only and none exist on macOS, so without the `Darwin` branch the script silently falls through and opens nothing. Always print the path regardless of whether an opener was found — that is the part the user can still act on.

If config is missing or stale, redirect to `workspace-setup`.
